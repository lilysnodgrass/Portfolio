                We brainstormed ideas using Miro's sticky note feature, voted via color-coded stars, 
                and after some discussion settled with our idea: an app to find new things to do in your area, 
                with the ability to share and coordinate with others.<br><br>

                We created a proto persona, along with an interview plan, based on the initial idea we had of a user who would be looking for something to do on the weekend with their friends. Elise Smith is a young woman who really enjoys getting to know the area she lives in, and as she just moved to Austin, she's trying to get to know this city better, as well as get to know her new coworkers.

                <p class="text-white">
                    Our interview and research plan focused on learning about the types of things users pursue during their free time, how they discover or find those things, and what factors were important in making decisions on what to do. We also asked users if they had any desired improvements within their process of finding new things to do.<br><br>
                    We discovered that users often use multiple tools, as well as gathering and saving recommendations from others to find new things to do or places to go, but lack a way of saving them.

                <p class="text-white">
                    We discovered that users most freqently seek eating and going for drinks at new-to-them restaurants and bars, exploring and enjoying the outdoors, excercising, going shopping, and going to a variety of events. Users use tools like yelp, do512, and social media to discover new experiences and activities, and frequently read reviews within those tools, and consider them in logistics and planning.<br><br>
                    The main things users wished for were having everything in one place, instead of using multuple tools; and the ability to filter things based on factors such as budget, proximity, level of activity or intensity, and time allowance.<br><br>

                <p class="text-white">
                    Based on the data collected from user interviews, we formed our user persona, Sarah Wheeler, a 27-year-old who recently moved to Austin for a job as a data analyst with a new company. We've all been there, finding yourself in a new place, no regular haunts, no go-tos for things to do, it can be extremely daunting trying to orient yourself in your new environment! Sarah was our way of connecting with the pain points of our users, better understanding the behaviors and needs of our users, creating empathy via thinking through ideas as if Sarah was a new coworker or friend. This viewpoint also functioned as a way to ensure that the design decisions made were influened by the actual behaviors of the users (or potential users) interviewed.

                    It's always helpful to have a quick reference point during any process to maintain consistency throughout, from conception to completion. From our user persona, Sarah Wheeler, we condensed the major pain points and potential solutions into an empathy map. This exercise helped us maintain focus on the primary issues and proceeding potential solutions, of simplifying the planning and scheduling while maximizing the actual experience, helping make Sarah's new life in Austin more enjoyable, comfortable, and unique.
