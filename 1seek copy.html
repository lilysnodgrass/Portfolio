                and after some discussion settled with our idea: an app to find new things to do in your area,

                We created a proto persona, along with an interview plan, based on the initial idea we had of a user who would be looking for something to do on the weekend with their friends. Elise Smith is a young woman who really enjoys getting to know the area she lives in, and as she just moved to Austin, she's trying to get to know this city better, as well as get to know her new coworkers.

                <p class="text-white">
                    Our interview and research plan focused on learning about the types of things users pursue during their free time, how they discover or find those things, and what factors were important in making decisions on what to do. We also asked users if they had any desired improvements within their process of finding new things to do.<br><br>
                    We discovered that users often use multiple tools, as well as gathering and saving recommendations from others to find new things to do or places to go, but lack a way of saving them.

                <p class="text-white">
                    We learned that users most freqently seek eating and going for drinks at new-to-them restaurants and bars, exploring and enjoying the outdoors, excercising, going shopping, and going to a variety of events. Users use tools like yelp, do512, and social media to discover new experiences and activities, and frequently read reviews within those tools, and consider them in logistics and planning.<br><br>
                    The main things users wished for were having everything in one place, instead of using multuple tools; and the ability to filter things based on factors such as budget, proximity, level of activity or intensity, and time allowance.<br><br>

                <p class="text-white">
                    Based on the data collected from user interviews, we formed our user persona, Sarah Wheeler, a 27-year-old who recently moved to Austin for a job as a data analyst with a new company. We've all been there, finding yourself in a new place, no regular haunts, no go-tos for things to do, it can be extremely daunting trying to orient yourself in your new environment! Sarah was our way of connecting with the pain points of our users, better understanding the behaviors and needs of our users, creating empathy via thinking through ideas as if Sarah was a new coworker or friend. This viewpoint also functioned as a way to ensure that the design decisions made were influened by the actual behaviors of the users (or potential users) interviewed.

                <p class="text-white">
                    It's always helpful to have a quick reference point during any process to maintain consistency throughout, from conception to completion. From our user persona, Sarah Wheeler, we condensed the major pain points and potential solutions into an empathy map. This exercise helped us maintain focus on the primary issues and proceeding potential solutions, of simplifying the planning and scheduling while maximizing the actual experience, helping make Sarah's new life in Austin more enjoyable, comfortable, and unique.

                <p class="text-white">
                    Instead of using "I Like, I Wish, What If" as a method of recording constructive critiques of our first prototype, our group chose to use it as another way to empathize with Sarah directly, further breaking things down to the bare basics a second time. We solidified the objectives of users into each category, straying from the standard us of this exercise, which helped further ensure that all team members were on the same page.

                    Douplicating the sticky notes from the I Like, I Wish exercise, we created a feature prioritization matrix, which helped us to define the most important - as well as achievable - objectives in designing this mobile app. The stickies in green give a basic outline of pros vs. cons per section of the matrix, while the purple stickies are douplications of ones from the "What If" column of the I Like, I Wish, What If exercise, categorized by how complicated achieving each idea would be, along with the potential benefits to the user.

                    Building upon what was determined to be the most beneficial feature to the user, Sarah, we created a storyboard that would help our team to focus further into fully understanding what Sarah was tryin to accomplish, then creating the most fitting solution.

                    From the storyboard, we elaborated further to create the user journey map, which expanded upon the basic storyboard for our user, Sarah. We are once again able to walk in Sarah's shoes, trying to even better understand the process within which we are creating a solution.

                    The final color palette consists of varying values of yellow-orange, blue, and cool grey. I began to implement material design within the UI of our frames, but we decided to continue with keeping the list items, or cards, a darker value than the background. This choice of effectively reversing the standard material design fabricated depth perception was solely based on the time constraints of this project.<br><br>
                    For the information architecture (rather, organization of content), we decided to create a distinction between users who would seek activities by a specific date or by type of activity. Some of my team preferred to first select a date, while the rest preferred to first search by type of activity. As our users are hoping to both plan for things days in advance as well as find something to do in the moment, we left the process open and with minimal constraints so our users like Sarah have the freedom to explore however they please.<br><br>
                    The organization or structure of discovering new experiences is based upon the type of activity, which we divided into six basic categories: Food & Drink, Arts & Music, Outdoors, Fitness, Kid-Friendly, and Volunteer Opportunities. Each of those main categories contains different sections, categorized / organized by things venue or location, choice of cuisine, level of intensity, all depending on the initial basic category. <br><br><br>

                    <li>flesh out the collection of saved / hearted items within one main "wishlist", and add the ability to create new lists, organize items within those lists, as well as create an option to mark things you've already done</li><br>
                    <!-- <li>potentially create a notes or personal recommendations section, based off of the utility note apps on smart phones, where users can jot ideas down for things they want to do, and better organize thoughts, so users can quickly scribble (frantically type) things down before they forget, so they aren't trying to remember that one place that their boss told them they needed to try for lunch (or was it happy hour?) on Tuesdays, and so they can easily reference a list of ideas for things the whole family can do together, and choose a type of thing quickly and get to enjoying it sooner than having to think of something in the moment. </li><br><br> -->
                    <li>even though this is less of a step for the production process of the Seek app, and more of a note-to-self, I plan on making it a clearly defined and required section on the individual item pages to list any materials or equipment needed, as well as a section for recommended items such as sun screen, weather-specific attire, reusable water bottle etc, so users can plan ahead and ensure they can enjoy their experience to the fullest in the moment. I also plan to have a section on the item page template / layout for complexity, intensity, duration, suggested time-allotment per activity, again so users can be fully prepared and choose activities or things to do based on their preferences for how long they'd like to be active for, how much time in direct sun, etc, the sky's the limit! </li>

            <div class="row justify-content-center col-8 p-3 text-white">This was our first group project during the 2021 Summer UX UI Boot Camp through UT Austin, and throughout this process, we were still familiarizing ourselves with our tools and software. The learning curve was a bit tricky for this project, we were still getting a grasp the material we're trying to put into action. I started noticing I was second-guessing myself frequently, overanalyzing interactions with teammates, and generally feeling disconnected due to the fact that our cohort was completely remote through Zoom.<br><br>
            Past my personal setbacks, this first project was an rough reminder that there are many interpretations of "good design". Sometimes designs work well with an abundance of bold and bright color, sometimes it's just not the right environment for them. In reflecting on this project, I learned an invaluable fall-back ideaology: Occam's Razor.<br><br>
            I'm very invested in this idea, it's something that I've been daydreaming about for years, primarily developed over time as I've learned how to better organize my personal life. I hope to help develop tools, like Seek, that could provide users with peace of mind through ease of use.
